StashSorter is a simple c# GUI software that makes it simple to do changes to .stash.
It connects directly to the .stash sqlite.

Functions are
1: Search
2: Set/Remove performer
3: Set/Remove Studio
4: Set/Remove Tag
5: Auto tag (This goes through the list of perfomers and tries to match them to the Path name, if it's a hit, the perfoermer will be added to that scene)

This only works for Scenes. All creation of new perfomers, tags and studios needs to be done in .Stash Webui.
